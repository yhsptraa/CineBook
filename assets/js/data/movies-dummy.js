                Two years after the battle of Sokovia, Thor defeats the fire demon Surtur and takes his crown, believing he has prevented the prophesied destruction of Asgard. He returns home to expose Loki, who has been impersonating Odin, and the brothers find their dying father in Norway. Odin's death releases Hela, their ruthless elder sister and the former leader of Asgard's armies. She destroys Mjolnir, casts Thor and Loki out of the Bifrost, and seizes the throne.
                Thor lands on Sakaar, where the Grandmaster forces him into gladiatorial combat against his former ally, the Hulk. Loki has already secured a place in the Grandmaster's court, while the bounty hunter who captured Thor is revealed to be the last surviving Valkyrie. Thor discovers that his power does not come from his hammer and persuades Valkyrie, Bruce Banner, and eventually Loki to help him escape.
                The group returns to Asgard as Hela's army closes in on Heimdall and the surviving citizens. Hulk battles Fenris, Valkyrie confronts Hela's warriors, and Loki arrives with Sakaar's freed gladiators to evacuate the population. Realizing that Hela draws her strength from Asgard itself, Thor sends Loki to place Surtur's crown in the Eternal Flame.
                Reborn at full strength, Surtur destroys Asgard and Hela with it while Thor leads his people to safety. Thor accepts his role as king and chooses Earth as their destination, but their ship is intercepted by a far larger vessel. The Grandmaster, meanwhile, is left to face the revolutionaries who overthrew him.

                In 1988, the young Peter Quill is abducted from Earth shortly after his mother's death and raised by Yondu Udonta's band of space pirates, the Ravagers. Twenty-six years later, Quill steals a mysterious Orb from the abandoned planet Morag. The theft puts him between Yondu, the fanatical Kree warrior Ronan the Accuser, and Gamora, an assassin sent to recover the object.
                On Xandar, Quill, Gamora, Rocket, and Groot are arrested after fighting over the Orb. In prison they meet Drax, who wants revenge on Ronan for murdering his family. Gamora reveals that she intends to betray Ronan and sell the Orb to keep it from him, so the five prisoners stage an escape and travel to Knowhere. There, the Collector opens the Orb and identifies its contents as an Infinity Stone capable of destroying entire worlds.
                Ronan captures the Stone and embeds it in his warhammer, planning to annihilate Xandar before turning against Thanos. Quill reunites the fugitives, bargains with Yondu, and warns the Nova Corps. The Guardians, the Ravagers, and Xandar's defenders attack Ronan's flagship, but Groot sacrifices his body to protect his friends when the ship crashes into the city.
                Quill distracts Ronan long enough for Rocket and Drax to shatter the warhammer. Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Rocket share the Stone's power and use it to destroy Ronan. They entrust the Stone to the Nova Corps, have their criminal records cleared, and depart together aboard the rebuilt Milano with a sapling grown from Groot.

                After the death of King T'Chaka, his son T'Challa returns to the technologically advanced but hidden nation of Wakanda to inherit the throne. He is crowned after defeating M'Baku in ritual combat and takes up the mantle of Black Panther. During his first mission as king, T'Challa joins Okoye and Nakia in pursuing arms dealer Ulysses Klaue, who has stolen a Wakandan artifact containing vibranium.
                The operation in South Korea ends with Klaue in CIA custody, but Erik Stevens, known as Killmonger, breaks him free and later kills him. Killmonger enters Wakanda and reveals that he is the son of Prince N'Jobu, whom T'Chaka killed years earlier. He challenges T'Challa for the throne, defeats him, and orders Wakanda's weapons to be distributed to operatives around the world so oppressed people can rise against their governments.
                T'Challa survives with help from the Jabari tribe and is restored by the last heart-shaped herb. He returns with Nakia, Shuri, and CIA agent Everett Ross as Wakanda divides between forces loyal to him and those supporting Killmonger. T'Challa defeats his cousin in the vibranium mine, but Killmonger refuses treatment and chooses death over imprisonment.

                Recognizing the harm caused by Wakanda's isolation, T'Challa establishes an outreach center in Oakland and begins sharing the nation's knowledge with the world. At the United Nations, he publicly reveals Wakanda's true nature and promises that it will no longer watch from the shadows.

                Near the end of his house arrest for helping Captain America, Scott Lang experiences a vision of Janet van Dyne, who disappeared into the Quantum Realm decades earlier. Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne secretly bring Scott to their laboratory, believing his connection to Janet can help them locate and rescue her. Their work requires a component from black-market dealer Sonny Burch, but a phase-shifting attacker known as Ghost steals Pym's portable laboratory.
                Ghost is Ava Starr, whose body was destabilized by a quantum accident. Former S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist Bill Foster has kept her alive, and they plan to drain Janet's quantum energy as a cure even though the process may kill her. Hank, Hope, and Scott recover the laboratory while evading Ava, Burch's men, and FBI agent Jimmy Woo, who is monitoring Scott's sentence.
                Hank enters the Quantum Realm and finds Janet, while Scott and Hope fight to keep the tunnel operational. Janet returns safely and uses energy she gained in the realm to stabilize Ava temporarily. Scott reaches home moments before Woo checks on him, completing his house arrest without being caught.
                Later, Scott enters the Quantum Realm to collect healing particles for Ava. Before Hank, Janet, and Hope can bring him back, Thanos's snap turns all three to dust, leaving Scott stranded with no one operating the controls.

                In 1995, young Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova live in Ohio with Russian agents Alexei Shostakov and Melina Vostokoff, who pose as their parents. When the mission ends, the girls are taken to the Red Room and trained as Black Widows. Years later, after violating the Sokovia Accords, Natasha hides in Norway while Yelena is freed from the Red Room's chemical mind control and sends her sister vials of the antidote.
                The masked assassin Taskmaster attacks Natasha for the vials, leading her back to Yelena in Budapest. Yelena reveals that General Dreykov survived Natasha's earlier attempt to kill him and still controls Widows around the world. The sisters free Alexei from prison and find Melina, who helps them infiltrate the airborne Red Room despite initially alerting Dreykov.
                Dreykov reveals that Taskmaster is his daughter Antonia, gravely injured in Natasha's assassination attempt and remade into a soldier who can imitate any opponent. Natasha breaks the pheromone lock that prevents Widows from attacking Dreykov, obtains the locations of his agents, and releases the antidote as the Red Room collapses. Yelena destroys Dreykov's escape aircraft, while Natasha frees Antonia and cures her.
                Natasha gives Yelena the remaining antidote and the list of controlled Widows so they can be liberated. She stays behind to face the authorities, later receives a Quinjet, and leaves to help the imprisoned Avengers. After Natasha's death, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine directs Yelena's grief toward Clint Barton.

Thousands of years later, the Nine Realms begin to align in a rare event called the Convergence. While investigating portals in London, Jane Foster is transported to the Aether's hiding place and becomes its unwilling host.
                Thor takes Jane to Asgard, but the Aether's return awakens Malekith and his surviving army. Their assault leaves Asgard exposed and Frigga dead after she protects Jane.
